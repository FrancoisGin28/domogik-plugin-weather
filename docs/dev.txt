Sensors history
===============

Most of the sensors for this plugin have no history enabled by default. For example forecast data have no history as there is no need to keep forecast history!

Only the following sensors are configured to store the history:

* current_barometer_value
* current_humidity
* current_temperature
* current_wind_direction
* current_wind_gust
* current_wind_speed

Timeout on sensors
==================

All sensors have a timeout set to 65 minutes : as the interval between each check on weather.com is set to 30min, we let the plugin to encounter 1 failure.

Forecast data
=============

A specific xPL schema has been defined for the forecast: 

* **xpl-stat** ::

    xpl-stat
    {
    ...
    }
    weather.forecast
    {
        provider=yahoo weather
        day=<number of the day : 0....>
        day-name=...
        temperature-high=...
        temperature-low=...
        condition-text=...
        condition-code=...
    }

Condition codes
===============

Condition codes and texts are listed here: https://developer.yahoo.com/weather/documentation.html
